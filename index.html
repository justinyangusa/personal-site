			<h1>Hi! My name is Ish.</h1>

			<h2>Welcome to my humble (web-based) abode</h2>
			<p>Below are some resources for your convenience</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.github.com/theishshah">GitHub</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/theishshah">LinkedIn</a></li>
				<li><a href="resume.pdf">Resume</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that my shameless self-promotion of my GitHub, LinkedIn, and resume are over, I would like to thank you for visiting my webpage. Odds are that I handed you a resume, emailed you a link, and/or uploaded my resume, so it means a lot that you actually stopped by. I know you are probably super busy and have waaaay better things you could be doing with your time. To the people who are on a chance encounter or searched for me in your search engine of choice - you are awesome too!
			</p>
			<p>A little about me: I am a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois. I am originally from Colorado, and I will get abnormally excited if you are too. I love sports with an extreme passion and I would love to talk NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, PGA, and, even NCAA (yes, I am woefully aware that Illinois isn't great at sports). In addition to a healthy ESPN addiction, I love to create memes in my free time.
			</p>
			<p>Oh, and I guess I like computers too. I'm looking to enter the tech industry (or really any industry, most are doing really cool stuff with CS) and work on projects to help drive society forward.
