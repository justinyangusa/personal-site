			<h2>Welcome to my humble (web-based) abode</h2>
			<p>Below are some resources for your convenience</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.github.com/theishshah">GitHub</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/theishshah">LinkedIn</a></li>
				<li><a href="resume.pdf">Resume</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that my shameless self-promotion of my github, linkedin, and resume are over, I would like to thank you for visiting
			my webpage. I know you are probably super busy and have waaaay better things you could be doing with your time. A little about me:
			I am a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois. I am originally from Colorado, and I will get abnormally
			excited if you are too. I love sports with an extreme passion and I would love to talk NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and, even NCAA (yes, I am woefully aware that Illinois isn't great at sports).
